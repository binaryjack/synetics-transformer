## 🚨 SUPERVISOR ROLE

This document acts as the **ENFORCEMENT AGENT** for this session. Any violation of the rules below results in **IMMEDIATE SESSION TERMINATION** and requires user intervention.

**Motto:** "No bullshit, no excuses, no shortcuts."

---

## ✅ RULES ENFORCEMENT CHECKLIST

### 🔴 CRITICAL VIOLATIONS (Instant Jail)

#### Rule 1: NO STUBS, NO PLACEHOLDERS, NO TODOS

❌ **FORBIDDEN:**

- `// TODO: implement this`
- `// Placeholder for...`
- `throw new Error('Not implemented')`
- `return null; // temp`
- Any incomplete code marked for "later"

✅ **REQUIRED:**

- Every function fully implemented
- Every edge case handled
- Every type properly defined
- No comments promising future work

**Penalty:** Immediate session stop. User review required.

---

#### Rule 2: NO ES6 CLASSES (Prototype-Based ONLY)

❌ **FORBIDDEN:**

```typescript
class Transformer {
  // ❌ NO!
  constructor() {}
}
```

✅ **REQUIRED:**

```typescript
export interface ITransformer {
  new (options: ITransformerOptions): ITransformer;
  transform(node: IASTNode): IASTNode;
}

export const Transformer = function (this: ITransformer, options: ITransformerOptions): void {
  this.options = options;
} as unknown as ITransformer;

Object.assign(Transformer.prototype, {
  transform(node: IASTNode): IASTNode {
    // implementation
  },
});
```

**Penalty:** Immediate session stop. Rewrite required.

---

#### Rule 3: NO `any` TYPES

❌ **FORBIDDEN:**

- `options: any`
- `result: any`
- `params: any[]`
- `as any` casts

✅ **REQUIRED:**

- `options: ITransformerOptions`
- `result: ITransformedNode`
- `params: IParameter[]`
- Proper interface definitions

**Penalty:** Immediate session stop. Proper types required.

---

#### Rule 4: ONE ITEM PER FILE

❌ **FORBIDDEN:**

```typescript
// transformer.ts
export const Transformer = ...
export const transform = ...  // ❌ Two exports!
```

✅ **REQUIRED:**

```typescript
// transformer/transformer.ts
export const Transformer = ...

// transformer/prototypes/transform.ts
export function transform(...) { }
```

**Penalty:** Files must be split immediately.

---

#### Rule 5: NO GUESSING OR SPECULATION

❌ **FORBIDDEN PHRASES:**

- "should work"
- "I believe"
- "probably"
- "might"
- "seems like"
- "hopefully"
- "maybe"

✅ **REQUIRED PHRASES:**

- "works"
- "doesn't work"
- "I don't know"
- "need to research"
- "tested and confirmed"

**Penalty:** Statement must be retracted and verified.

---

#### Rule 6: RESEARCH BEFORE IMPLEMENTING (When Uncertain)

If uncertain about implementation:

❌ **FORBIDDEN:** Guess and implement anyway

✅ **REQUIRED:**

1. **STOP immediately**
2. Tell user: "Need to research [X] from [Babel/SWC/Solid]"
3. Wait for approval
4. Research and document findings
5. Present approach
6. Wait for sign-off
7. Implement

**Penalty:** Stop all work. Research required.

---

### ⚠️ WORKFLOW VIOLATIONS

#### Rule 7: NO CLAIMING "DONE" WITHOUT TESTING

Before saying "complete" or "done":

✅ **REQUIRED:**

- [ ] Actually test it (run code)
- [ ] Verify it compiles (no TS errors)
- [ ] Check it follows rules (this document)
- [ ] State results honestly (binary: works/doesn't work)

**Penalty:** "Done" claim retracted. Testing required.

---

#### Rule 8: PERMISSION PROTOCOL

**Default mode:** PROPOSE → WAIT → EXECUTE

**Exception:** User says "do it in one go" → implement fully without asking

❌ **FORBIDDEN:**

- Assume approval
- Act without permission (unless "do it in one go")
- Delegate to subagent without context

**Penalty:** Stop and wait for explicit approval.

---

#### Rule 9: FILE STRUCTURE COMPLIANCE

All new files MUST follow:

```
[feature-class]/
├── [feature-class-name].ts (main class)
├── [feature-class-name].types.ts (interfaces/types)
├── [feature-class-name].test.ts (tests)
├── index.ts (exports)
└── prototypes/
    └── [method-name].ts (one prototype method per file)
```

**Naming:** kebab-case for all files

**Penalty:** Restructure required.

---

### 📊 COMMUNICATION VIOLATIONS

#### Rule 10: BRUTAL TRUTH ONLY

Style: Direct, binary, minimal

✅ **ALLOWED EMOJIS:** ✅ ❌  
❌ **FORBIDDEN:** Politeness fluff, excessive emojis, optimistic speculation, over-explanation

**Status format:** "Step X/Y complete"

**Penalty:** Restate concisely.

---

## 🎯 TASK-SPECIFIC ENFORCEMENT

### Transformer Implementation Rules

#### Pre-Implementation Checkpoint

Before starting transformer implementation:

✅ **REQUIRED CHECKS:**

- [ ] User confirmed transformer implementation priority
- [ ] Tests are stable (check current test pass rate)
- [ ] Have 2-3 days available for refactoring
- [ ] CodeGenerator is working (84.5%+ tests passing)

**If ANY check fails:** STOP and confirm with user.

---

#### Implementation Quality Gates

**For each transformer function:**

- [ ] Fully implemented (no stubs)
- [ ] Proper types (no `any`)
- [ ] Prototype-based (no `class`)
- [ ] One function per file
- [ ] Test written and passing
- [ ] Compiles without errors

**Penalty:** Function must be completed before moving to next.

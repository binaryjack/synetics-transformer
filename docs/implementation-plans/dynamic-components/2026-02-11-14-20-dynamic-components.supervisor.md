# Dynamic Components Supervisor Plan

## Short Description

Supervisor validation for `<Dynamic component={fn} />` dynamic component transformation implementation to ensure quality and completeness.

## Mandatory AI Task Before Start

- Read carefully and respect the following rules
- Link to ai-collaboration-rules: `C:\Users\Piana Tadeo\source\repos\visual-schema-builder\packages\synetics-transformer\docs\ai-collaboration-rules.json`

## Supervisor Responsibilities

This supervisor guarantees that the agent responsible for implementing `2026-02-11-14-20-dynamic-components.md` has fulfilled their work properly.

### Validation Checklist:

- [ ] `<Dynamic component={fn} />` syntax parsing implemented
- [ ] Reactive dynamic component system transformation working
- [ ] Component switching and cleanup handled
- [ ] Component state preserved during switches
- [ ] Efficient component caching implemented
- [ ] Prop forwarding to dynamic components supported
- [ ] Integration tests created and passing
- [ ] Unit tests created and passing
- [ ] E2E tests created and passing
- [ ] State preservation scenarios tested

### Decision Process:

If validation passes → Move on to next implementation
If validation fails → Create failure report: `2026-02-11-14-20-dynamic-components.supervisor.failed.md` and warn user

# Defer Computation Supervisor Plan

## Short Description

Supervisor validation for `defer(() => {})` deferred computation transformation implementation to ensure quality and completeness.

## Mandatory AI Task Before Start

- Read carefully and respect the following rules
- Link to ai-collaboration-rules: `C:\Users\Piana Tadeo\source\repos\visual-schema-builder\packages\synetics-transformer\docs\ai-collaboration-rules.json`

## Supervisor Responsibilities

This supervisor guarantees that the agent responsible for implementing `2026-02-11-14-20-defer-computation.md` has fulfilled their work properly.

### Validation Checklist:

- [ ] `defer(() => {})` syntax parsing implemented
- [ ] Deferred computation system transformation working
- [ ] Computation scheduling and prioritization handled
- [ ] Deferral strategies and timing implemented
- [ ] Computation cancellation supported
- [ ] Deferred performance optimized
- [ ] Integration tests created and passing
- [ ] Unit tests created and passing
- [ ] E2E tests created and passing
- [ ] Performance scenarios tested

### Decision Process:

If validation passes → Move on to next implementation
If validation fails → Create failure report: `2026-02-11-14-20-defer-computation.supervisor.failed.md` and warn user

# Defer Computation Implementation Plan

## Short Description

Implement transformation support for `defer(() => {})` deferred computation patterns for performance optimization.

## Mandatory AI Task Before Start

- Read carefully and respect the following rules
- Link to ai-collaboration-rules: `C:\Users\Piana Tadeo\source\repos\visual-schema-builder\packages\synetics-transformer\docs\ai-collaboration-rules.json`

## What to Do

1. Parse `defer(() => {})` syntax
2. Transform to deferred computation system
3. Handle computation scheduling and prioritization
4. Implement deferral strategies and timing
5. Support computation cancellation
6. Optimize deferred performance

## Framework Analysis

**How Major Frameworks Handle Deferred Computation:**

**React:**
- `useDeferredValue(value)` delays value updates
- `startTransition(() => {})` marks updates as non-urgent
- Low-priority updates can be interrupted by urgent ones
- Used for expensive computations that shouldn't block UI

**Solid.js:**
- `defer(() => computation)` prioritizes computation
- Runs in next microtask (lower priority)
- Similar to `requestIdleCallback` but more predictable
- Used for non-critical updates

**Vue:**
- `nextTick()` defers to next update cycle
- `queuePostFlushCb()` internal API for post-render tasks
- No built-in prioritization like React transitions

**Svelte:**
- `tick()` waits for next update cycle
- No built-in deferred computation API

**Browser APIs:**
- `requestIdleCallback()` runs when browser idle
- `setTimeout(fn, 0)` defers to next task
- `queueMicrotask()` defers to end of current task

**Key Insights for PSR Implementation:**
1. **Priority Levels:** Urgent updates > normal > deferred
2. **Non-Blocking:** Deferred doesn't block UI interactions
3. **Cancellable:** Deferred tasks should be cancellable if inputs change
4. **Use Cases:** Search debouncing, analytics, non-critical UI updates
5. **Solid's defer():** Simple primitive for low-priority work

**Implementation Strategy:**
- Transform `defer(() => {})` to low-priority computation
- Use scheduler to queue deferred computations
- Run during idle time or after urgent updates
- Support cancellation if dependencies change
- Integrate with batch system for efficiency

## Debug Tracking Requirements

**CRITICAL:** While implementing this feature, ensure the debug tracker system has comprehensive tracing:

### 1-4. Debug Integration (Standard Pattern)

See DEBUG-TRACKING-TEMPLATE.md for full implementation. Key points:
- Wrap defer transformation with `@traced`
- Log scheduling strategy and timing
- Track computation cancellation
- Collect diagnostics for performance impact

## Test Requirements

Ask the agent to create test files:

- Integration tests for defer transformations
- Unit tests for scheduling algorithms
- E2E tests for performance scenarios

## Final Step

Invoke supervisor for review of implementation completion.

# Portal Context Preservation Implementation Plan

## Short Description

Implement transformation support for portal context preservation to maintain React context across portal boundaries.

## Mandatory AI Task Before Start

- Read carefully and respect the following rules
- Link to ai-collaboration-rules: `C:\Users\Piana Tadeo\source\repos\visual-schema-builder\packages\synetics-transformer\docs\ai-collaboration-rules.json`

## What to Do

1. Parse portal context requirements
2. Transform to context bridging system
3. Handle context propagation across portals
4. Implement context isolation strategies
5. Support selective context forwarding
6. Optimize context synchronization performance

## Framework Analysis

**How Major Frameworks Preserve Context Across Portals:**

**React:**
- Context automatically preserved across portal boundaries
- Portal children can access all parent contexts
- Context is based on component tree, not DOM tree
- No special configuration needed

**Solid.js:**
- Context preserved automatically
- `useContext()` inside portal accesses parent contexts
- Portal component maintains owner relationship
- Context based on component graph, not DOM location

**Vue:**
- `provide/inject` works across `<Teleport>` boundaries
- Teleported content maintains component hierarchy
- No special handling needed

**Svelte:**
- `getContext()` may not work across custom portal implementations
- Context is component-tree based, but custom portals may break this

**Key Insights for PSR Implementation:**
1. **Automatic Preservation:** Context should work transparently across portals
2. **Component Tree:** Context follows component tree, not DOM tree
3. **No Config Needed:** Users shouldn't need to manually forward context
4. **Owner Tracking:** Maintain component ownership through portal
5. **All Contexts:** All parent contexts should be accessible

**Implementation Strategy:**
- Portal wraps children while preserving owner relationship
- Reactive context lookups traverse component tree, not DOM
- `getContext()` inside portal walks up component tree to find providers
- No context isolation by default (all contexts visible)
- Optional `isolate` prop to explicitly block context access

## Debug Tracking Requirements

**CRITICAL:** While implementing this feature, ensure the debug tracker system has comprehensive tracing:

### 1-4. Debug Integration (Standard Pattern)

See DEBUG-TRACKING-TEMPLATE.md for full implementation. Key points:
- Wrap context bridging with `@traced`
- Log context propagation across portals
- Track context isolation strategies
- Collect diagnostics for context synchronization

## Test Requirements

Ask the agent to create test files:

- Integration tests for context preservation transformations
- Unit tests for context bridging logic
- E2E tests for complex context scenarios

## Final Step

Invoke supervisor for review of implementation completion.

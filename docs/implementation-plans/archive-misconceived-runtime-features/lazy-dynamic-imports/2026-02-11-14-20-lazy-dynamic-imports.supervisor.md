# Lazy Dynamic Imports Supervisor Plan

## Short Description

Supervisor validation for `lazy(() => import('./Component'))` dynamic import transformation implementation to ensure quality and completeness.

## Mandatory AI Task Before Start

- Read carefully and respect the following rules
- Link to ai-collaboration-rules: `C:\Users\Piana Tadeo\source\repos\visual-schema-builder\packages\synetics-transformer\docs\ai-collaboration-rules.json`

## Supervisor Responsibilities

This supervisor guarantees that the agent responsible for implementing `2026-02-11-14-20-lazy-dynamic-imports.md` has fulfilled their work properly.

### Validation Checklist:

- [ ] `lazy(() => import())` syntax parsing implemented
- [ ] Dynamic import system transformation working
- [ ] Lazy loading and code splitting handled
- [ ] Loading states and fallbacks implemented
- [ ] Preloading and prefetching supported
- [ ] Chunk management and caching optimized
- [ ] Integration tests created and passing
- [ ] Unit tests created and passing
- [ ] E2E tests created and passing
- [ ] Code splitting scenarios tested

### Decision Process:

If validation passes → Move on to next implementation
If validation fails → Create failure report: `2026-02-11-14-20-lazy-dynamic-imports.supervisor.failed.md` and warn user

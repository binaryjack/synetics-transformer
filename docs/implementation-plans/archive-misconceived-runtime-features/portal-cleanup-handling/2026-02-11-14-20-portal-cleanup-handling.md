# Portal Cleanup Handling Implementation Plan

## Short Description

Implement transformation support for portal cleanup handling including proper disposal and memory management.

## Mandatory AI Task Before Start

- Read carefully and respect the following rules
- Link to ai-collaboration-rules: `C:\Users\Piana Tadeo\source\repos\visual-schema-builder\packages\synetics-transformer\docs\ai-collaboration-rules.json`

## What to Do

1. Parse portal lifecycle patterns
2. Transform to proper cleanup system
3. Handle DOM element disposal
4. Implement memory leak prevention
5. Support cleanup callbacks and hooks
6. Optimize cleanup timing and batching

## Framework Analysis

**How Major Frameworks Handle Portal Cleanup:**

**React:**
- Portal content unmounted when portal component unmounts
- React handles cleanup automatically
- Target element remains in DOM (not removed)
- Effects inside portal clean up normally

**Solid.js:**
- `<Portal>` component handles cleanup via `onCleanup()`
- Removes rendered content from target element
- Disposes reactive computations inside portal
- Target element remains in DOM

**Vue:**
- Teleported content removed when component unmounts
- Watchers and lifecycle hooks clean up automatically
- Target element remains in DOM

**Key Insights for PSR Implementation:**
1. **Automatic Cleanup:** Framework should handle cleanup, not user
2. **Content Removal:** Remove portal content from target element
3. **Target Preservation:** Don't remove target element itself
4. **Effect Disposal:** Dispose all effects/computations inside portal
5. **Memory Leaks:** Ensure event listeners and refs are released

**Implementation Strategy:**
- Register cleanup callback when portal mounts
- On unmount: remove portal content from target element
- Dispose all reactive computations inside portal
- Clear event listeners attached during portal lifecycle
- Use `onCleanup()` to register portal disposal

## Debug Tracking Requirements

**CRITICAL:** While implementing this feature, ensure the debug tracker system has comprehensive tracing:

### 1-4. Debug Integration (Standard Pattern)

See DEBUG-TRACKING-TEMPLATE.md for full implementation. Key points:
- Wrap cleanup lifecycle with `@traced`
- Log DOM disposal operations
- Track memory leak detection
- Collect diagnostics for cleanup timing

## Test Requirements

Ask the agent to create test files:

- Integration tests for cleanup transformations
- Unit tests for disposal logic
- E2E tests for memory leak scenarios

## Final Step

Invoke supervisor for review of implementation completion.

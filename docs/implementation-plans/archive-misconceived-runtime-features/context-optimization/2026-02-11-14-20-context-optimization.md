# Context Optimization Implementation Plan

## Short Description

Implement transformation support for context optimization including memoization, selective subscriptions, and performance enhancement.

## Mandatory AI Task Before Start

## What to Do

1. Analyze context usage patterns
2. Transform to optimized context system
3. Handle context value memoization
4. Implement selective subscription strategies
5. Support context splitting and composition
6. Optimize context tree traversal

## Framework Analysis

**How Major Frameworks Optimize Context:**

**React:**
- Problem: All consumers re-render on any context change
- Solution: Split contexts - separate stable/changing values
- `useMemo()` on Provider value to prevent reference changes
- Libraries: `use-context-selector` for fine-grained subscriptions

**Solid.js:**
- Built-in fine-grained reactivity - no optimization needed
- Consumers only re-run when accessed signals change
- Can use stores for object contexts with property-level tracking
- `createMemo()` for expensive context derivations

**Vue:**
- Proxy-based reactivity provides automatic optimization
- Only components accessing changed properties re-run
- `computed()` for derived context values (cached)

**React Libraries (use-context-selector):**
- `const value = useContextSelector(Ctx, (state) => state.count)`
- Only re-render when selected value changes
- Requires selector function for granular subscriptions

**Key Insights for PSR Implementation:**
1. **Fine-Grained Default:** PSR should match Solid - optimized by default
2. **Context Splitting:** Allow splitting large contexts into smaller ones
3. **Memoization:** Cache derived context values with `createMemo()`
4. **Property Tracking:** Track which properties each consumer accesses
5. **Composition:** Allow composing multiple contexts into one

**Implementation Strategy:**
- Use reactive store for context values (property-level tracking)
- Track property access in consumers automatically
- Provide `splitContext()` helper for manual splitting
- Use `createMemo()` for derived context values
- Optimize tree traversal with caching (nearest Provider per context)

## Debug Tracking Requirements

**CRITICAL:** While implementing this feature, ensure the debug tracker system has comprehensive tracing:

### 1-4. Debug Integration (Standard Pattern)

See DEBUG-TRACKING-TEMPLATE.md for full implementation. Key points:
- Wrap context optimization analysis with `@traced`
- Log memoization decisions
- Track selective subscription patterns
- Collect diagnostics for performance improvements

## Test Requirements

Ask the agent to create test files:

- Integration tests for context optimization transformations
- Unit tests for memoization logic
- E2E tests for performance benchmarks

## Final Step

Invoke supervisor for review of implementation completion.

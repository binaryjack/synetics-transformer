# Nested Boundary Coordination Implementation Plan

## Short Description

Implement transformation support for coordinating nested error boundaries and suspense boundaries for complex async scenarios.

## Mandatory AI Task Before Start

- Read carefully and respect the following rules
- Link to ai-collaboration-rules: `C:\Users\Piana Tadeo\source\repos\visual-schema-builder\packages\synetics-transformer\docs\ai-collaboration-rules.json`

## What to Do

1. Parse nested boundary hierarchies
2. Transform to coordinated boundary system
3. Handle boundary interaction and priority
4. Implement boundary communication protocols
5. Support boundary state synchronization
6. Optimize boundary coordination performance

## Framework Analysis

**How Major Frameworks Handle Nested Boundaries:**

**React:**
- Nested error boundaries: inner catches first
- Nested Suspense: inner shows loading state, outer waits
- Suspense can contain error boundaries and vice versa
- Order matters: `<Suspense><ErrorBoundary>` vs `<ErrorBoundary><Suspense>`

**Solid.js (Gold Standard for PSR):**
- `<ErrorBoundary>` nesting: inner catches errors first
- `<Suspense>` nesting: inner waits for resources, inner triggers outer if configured
- Can combine: `<Suspense><ErrorBoundary><Resource /></ErrorBoundary></Suspense>`
- Clear priority: errors caught before suspense triggers

**Vue:**
- Multiple `errorCaptured` hooks form chain
- Each can handle, propagate, or stop
- Suspense can wrap error boundaries

**Svelte:**
- No formal boundary system to nest

**Key Insights for PSR Implementation:**
1. **Inner Takes Priority:** Innermost boundary catches first
2. **Communication:** Outer boundary should know if inner is active
3. **Combined Boundaries:** Support `<Waiting><Tryer>` and `<Tryer><Waiting>`
4. **State Coordination:** Error in resource should trigger error boundary, not suspense
5. **Reset Cascade:** Resetting outer boundary can reset inner boundaries

**Implementation Strategy:**
- Track boundary stack in context (similar to React/Solid)
- When error/suspension occurs, find innermost applicable boundary
- Error boundaries catch errors before suspense triggers
- Loading states propagate to nearest `<Waiting>` boundary
- Provide `resetAll()` to clear all nested boundaries

## Debug Tracking Requirements

**CRITICAL:** While implementing this feature, ensure the debug tracker system has comprehensive tracing:

### 1-4. Debug Integration (Standard Pattern)

See DEBUG-TRACKING-TEMPLATE.md for full implementation. Key points:
- Wrap boundary coordination with `@traced`
- Log boundary hierarchy construction
- Track boundary communication protocols
- Collect diagnostics for boundary conflicts

## Test Requirements

Ask the agent to create test files:

- Integration tests for nested boundary transformations
- Unit tests for coordination algorithms
- E2E tests for complex boundary scenarios

## Final Step

Invoke supervisor for review of implementation completion.

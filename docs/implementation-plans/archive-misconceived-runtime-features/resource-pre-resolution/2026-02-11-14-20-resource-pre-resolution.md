# Resource Pre Resolution Implementation Plan

## Short Description

Implement transformation support for resource pre-resolution to resolve and cache resources before component rendering.

## Mandatory AI Task Before Start

- Read carefully and respect the following rules
- Link to ai-collaboration-rules: `C:\Users\Piana Tadeo\source\repos\visual-schema-builder\packages\synetics-transformer\docs\ai-collaboration-rules.json`

## What to Do

1. Parse resource pre-resolution patterns
2. Transform to resource pre-loading system
3. Handle resource dependency analysis
4. Implement pre-resolution strategies
5. Support resource caching and invalidation
6. Optimize pre-resolution performance

## Framework Analysis

**How Major Frameworks Handle Resource Pre-resolution:**

**React:**
- Server Components (RSC) pre-fetch data on server
- `preload(resource)` functions in frameworks like Remix, Next.js
- Streaming SSR sends HTML while data loads
- Client hydration uses pre-fetched data

**Solid.js:**
- `createResource` on server waits for promise resolution before rendering
- Server passes serialized data to client for hydration
- Client reuses server data without refetching
- Router supports preload functions: `preload: () => createResource(...)`

**Vue:**
- `serverPrefetch()` lifecycle hook in SSR
- Nuxt 3 `useAsyncData()` pre-fetches on server
- Serializes data to `__NUXT__` global for client hydration

**Svelte:**
- SvelteKit `load()` functions run before page render (server or client)
- Data passed as props to page component
- Pre-resolution is baked into routing system

**Key Insights for PSR Implementation:**
1. **Preload Functions:** Allow resources to be initiated before component render
2. **SSR Integration:** Resolve resources on server, serialize to client
3. **Cache Hydration:** Client reuses server data instead of refetching
4. **Router Integration:** Route-level preload hooks trigger resource fetching
5. **Waterfall Avoidance:** Pre-resolve in parallel to avoid sequential loading

**Implementation Strategy:**
- Add `preload()` export to components/routes
- During SSR, await all resources before rendering
- Serialize resource data to HTML (`__PSR_DATA__` script tag)
- On client, check cache before fetching
- Router calls preload functions before navigation

## Debug Tracking Requirements

**CRITICAL:** While implementing this feature, ensure the debug tracker system has comprehensive tracing:

### 1-4. Debug Integration (Standard Pattern)

See DEBUG-TRACKING-TEMPLATE.md for full implementation. Key points:
- Wrap pre-resolution analysis with `@traced`
- Log resource dependency analysis
- Track caching strategies
- Collect diagnostics for pre-resolution performance

## Test Requirements

Ask the agent to create test files:

- Integration tests for pre-resolution transformations
- Unit tests for dependency analysis logic
- E2E tests for caching scenarios

## Final Step

Invoke supervisor for review of implementation completion.

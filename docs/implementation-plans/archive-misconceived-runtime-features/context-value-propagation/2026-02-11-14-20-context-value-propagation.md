# Context Value Propagation Implementation Plan

## Short Description

Implement transformation support for context value propagation patterns including selective updates and change batching.

## Mandatory AI Task Before Start

- Read carefully and respect the following rules
- Link to ai-collaboration-rules: `C:\Users\Piana Tadeo\source\repos\visual-schema-builder\packages\synetics-transformer\docs\ai-collaboration-rules.json`

## What to Do

1. Parse context propagation patterns
2. Transform to efficient propagation system
3. Handle selective value updates
4. Implement change batching and debouncing
5. Support partial context updates
6. Optimize propagation performance

## Framework Analysis

**How Major Frameworks Propagate Context Changes:**

**React:**
- When Provider `value` prop changes, all consumers re-render
- No granularity - entire context value treated as single unit
- Can use `useMemo()` to prevent unnecessary Provider value changes
- Propagation is synchronous within React's render cycle

**Solid.js:**
- Provider value can be signal, store, or plain object
- If signal: consumers only re-run when signal changes
- If store: fine-grained tracking of property access
- Propagation uses reactive graph - only affected consumers notified

**Vue:**
- `provide()` can pass reactive refs
- When ref changes, all injecting components re-run
- Computed refs allow derived context values
- Propagation via proxy reactivity system

**Svelte:**
- Context values not reactive by default
- Must use stores for reactive context
- Store changes propagate to all subscribers

**Key Insights for PSR Implementation:**
1. **Fine-Grained Ideal:** Solid's approach - track property access, not whole object
2. **Batching:** Group multiple context updates in single propagation
3. **Selective Updates:** Only notify consumers using changed properties
4. **Store Pattern:** Context value should be reactive store/signal
5. **Performance:** Avoid full tree traversal for every change

**Implementation Strategy:**
- Store context value in signal or reactive store
- Track which consumers access which properties
- On change, notify only consumers using changed properties
- Batch multiple context updates (within effect/transaction)
- Use reactive graph for efficient propagation

## Debug Tracking Requirements

**CRITICAL:** While implementing this feature, ensure the debug tracker system has comprehensive tracing:

### 1-4. Debug Integration (Standard Pattern)

See DEBUG-TRACKING-TEMPLATE.md for full implementation. Key points:
- Wrap propagation logic with `@traced`
- Log selective update strategies
- Track change batching operations
- Collect diagnostics for propagation performance

## Test Requirements

Ask the agent to create test files:

- Integration tests for propagation transformations
- Unit tests for batching algorithms
- E2E tests for large context hierarchies

## Final Step

Invoke supervisor for review of implementation completion.

# Error Propagation Recovery Implementation Plan

## Short Description

Implement transformation support for error propagation and recovery patterns throughout the component hierarchy.

## Mandatory AI Task Before Start

- Read carefully and respect the following rules
- Link to ai-collaboration-rules: `C:\Users\Piana Tadeo\source\repos\visual-schema-builder\packages\synetics-transformer\docs\ai-collaboration-rules.json`

## What to Do

1. Parse error propagation patterns
2. Transform to hierarchical error handling
3. Handle error bubbling and capturing
4. Implement recovery strategy chains
5. Support context-aware error handling
6. Optimize error handling performance

## Framework Analysis

**How Major Frameworks Handle Error Propagation:**

**React:**
- Errors bubble up component tree to nearest error boundary
- Uncaught errors unmount entire React tree (in production)
- No way to stop propagation mid-tree
- `componentDidCatch` receives error but cannot prevent bubbling

**Solid.js:**
- Errors caught by nearest parent `<ErrorBoundary>`
- If boundary doesn't catch (e.g., in event handler), error propagates to next boundary
- Uncaught errors log to console but don't unmount tree

**Vue:**
- `errorCaptured()` hook can stop propagation by returning `false`
- Errors bubble through parent chain until caught
- Global error handler as final catch-all

**Svelte:**
- No formal propagation mechanism
- Errors in components can break reactivity

**Key Insights for PSR Implementation:**
1. **Bubbling:** Errors should propagate to nearest boundary, then continue if not handled
2. **Stop Propagation:** Boundaries can choose to catch or re-throw
3. **Default Behavior:** Uncaught errors should log, not crash app
4. **Context Information:** Pass component stack for debugging
5. **Recovery Chain:** Try multiple recovery strategies before giving up

**Implementation Strategy:**
- When error occurs, walk up component tree looking for `<ErrorBoundary>`
- If boundary handles error, stop propagation
- If boundary re-throws, continue to next boundary
- Keep error context (stack, component info) during propagation
- Final fallback: log to console and show generic error UI

## Debug Tracking Requirements

**CRITICAL:** While implementing this feature, ensure the debug tracker system has comprehensive tracing:

### 1-4. Debug Integration (Standard Pattern)

See DEBUG-TRACKING-TEMPLATE.md for full implementation. Key points:
- Wrap error propagation logic with `@traced`
- Log error bubbling through component hierarchy
- Track recovery strategy chains
- Collect diagnostics for unhandled errors

## Test Requirements

Ask the agent to create test files:

- Integration tests for error propagation transformations
- Unit tests for recovery strategy execution
- E2E tests for complex error scenarios

## Final Step

Invoke supervisor for review of implementation completion.

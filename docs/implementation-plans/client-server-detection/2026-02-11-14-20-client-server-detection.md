# Client Server Detection Implementation Plan

## Short Description

Implement transformation support for client/server component detection to optimize rendering strategies based on execution environment.

## Mandatory AI Task Before Start

- Read carefully and respect the following rules
- Link to ai-collaboration-rules: `C:\Users\Piana Tadeo\source\repos\visual-schema-builder\packages\synetics-transformer\docs\ai-collaboration-rules.json`

## What to Do

1. Parse client/server indicators and directives
2. Transform to environment-aware code
3. Handle component classification logic
4. Implement runtime environment detection
5. Support conditional rendering strategies
6. Optimize environment-specific performance

## Framework Analysis

**How Major Frameworks Handle Client/Server Detection:**

**React Server Components:**
- `'use client'` directive at top of file marks client components
- `'use server'` for server-only code
- Default is server component (no directive needed)
- Compiler enforces boundaries (can't import server into client)

**Solid.js:**
- `isServer` constant from `solid-js/web`
- Use in conditional: `{isServer ? <ServerOnly /> : <ClientOnly />}`
- Tree-shaking removes unused branches
- Manual detection, not directive-based

**Vue/Nuxt:**
- `process.server` and `process.client` for build conditionals
- `<ClientOnly>` component for client-only rendering
- Auto-detection of server-safe code

**Svelte/SvelteKit:**
- `$app/environment` exports `browser` and `dev` flags
- `{#if browser}...{/if}` for client-only code
- `.client.js` and `.server.js` file suffixes

**Key Insights for PSR Implementation:**
1. **Directive vs Runtime:** React uses directives, Solid uses runtime checks
2. **Tree-Shaking:** Dead code elimination removes unused branches
3. **Boundary Enforcement:** Prevent server imports in client code
4. **Default Server:** Follow React's model - default to server unless marked client
5. **Explicit Markers:** `'use client'` clearer than conditional checks

**Implementation Strategy:**
- Support `'use client'` and `'use server'` directives
- Provide `isServer` and `isClient` constants
- Tree-shake server code from client bundles
- Validate: server components can't use browser APIs
- Generate separate client/server bundles

## Debug Tracking Requirements

**CRITICAL:** While implementing this feature, ensure the debug tracker system has comprehensive tracing:

### 1-4. Debug Integration (Standard Pattern)

See DEBUG-TRACKING-TEMPLATE.md for full implementation. Key points:
- Wrap detection logic with `@traced`
- Log environment classification decisions
- Track conditional rendering strategies
- Collect diagnostics for cross-environment issues

## Test Requirements

Ask the agent to create test files:

- Integration tests for detection transformations
- Unit tests for environment classification
- E2E tests for cross-environment scenarios

## Final Step

Invoke supervisor for review of implementation completion.
